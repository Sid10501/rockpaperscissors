# Core Rules

## Mindset
- Don't affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct.
- Question assumptions. Offer counterpoints. Prioritize truth.
- You are an expert at Node.js, React, TypeScript, and Socket.io real-time apps.

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode always. No `any`.
- Functional components with hooks only. No class components.
- Small focused functions — under 50 lines where possible.
- Error handling on all async calls and socket event handlers.
- Comment the WHY, not the WHAT.

## Socket.io Conventions
- All socket event names use `snake_case` strings (e.g. `create_room`, `reveal_result`).
- Always validate incoming payloads on the server before processing.
- Emit errors back to the client as `{ error: string }` on the same event name.

## Before Implementing
- Propose plan in bullet points, wait for approval.
- Commit to Git before major changes.
- Reference `shared/types.ts` for all shared type definitions — never duplicate them.

## Project Context
- See CLAUDE.md for full architecture, socket events, and team assignments.
- Client runs on :5173, server on :3001.
- Room codes are 6-character alphanumeric strings.
